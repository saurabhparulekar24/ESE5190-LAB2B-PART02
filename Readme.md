# REPL
REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop, The REPL allows us to input commands from the terminal windows of out computer, and perform some actions. You can create different commands
which perform certain actions.
As we are building the REPL from scratch, we decided to use single character commands(we started experimenting and kinda stuck with it), you can also use strings as your commands

For explanation of the code, you can diretly open the REPL_console.c file, the code is explained through the comments, also read the supporting files or dependencies which are 
sio_registers.c,pixel.c,data_transfer.c,button_capture.c

This REPL consolidates all the functionality expected in the current and following parts i.e read/write registers, GPIO, sequencer and slowmo
